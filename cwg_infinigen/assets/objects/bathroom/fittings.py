"""One chrome finish shared by every bathroom fitting in a scene.

Taps, shower valves, rails and hooks in a real bathroom are bought as a set, so
they need to agree. Each factory used to sample its own metal - the sink tap in
particular drew from a list that could hand it a near-white finish - which left
the fittings looking like they came from four different suppliers.
